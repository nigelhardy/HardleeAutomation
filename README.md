Home automation
I made a server using NodeJS on a Rapsberry Pi to control a few things around the house.

I know the code isn't beautiful and nicely encapsulated, but it works flawlessly. My hardware implementation is fairly unique and I don't think it is worth the time to make it more accessible. Feel free to use this as a guide, and ask any questions you have, but I am not providing any type of official support. 

Thanks for stopping by!
